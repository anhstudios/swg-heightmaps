#SWG:ANH Heightmaps/Watermaps

Height/water maps are used in SWG to determine the height or water placement of a given position. This is vital for many aspects of the game and therefore an effort has been made to bring them to the SWG:ANH servers.

In the future this project space will host at minimum an editor for modifying data within our own heightmaps, for now the currently generated heightmaps are available in the downloads section.

## Install

Download and extract all of the planet heightmap files into the data/heightmaps directory of the SWG:ANH MMOServer project. After successfully building the project you will be able to load up the planets with their respective heightmap files.

Download Heightmaps from https://github.com/anhstudios/swg-heightmaps/downloads
